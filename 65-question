Communication

Maintained effective and clear communication with peers by proactively guiding them on how to integrate and use the common components developed in the Reusable Component Library (RCL).

Provided support both over calls and via detailed written instructions—even in situations where I was multitasking or away from my primary work setup—to ensure smooth understanding and usage of the components. Ensured that any confusion regarding component usage or requirements was promptly addressed, enabling team members to stay unblocked and aligned.

Business Scope

Demonstrated strong ownership by identifying potential risks and technical issues during the development of common components and while working on library replacements.

Proactively communicated these risks to the Team Lead well in advance, allowing timely intervention and mitigation planning. This helped avoid last-minute delivery challenges and ensured smooth progress across multiple project timelines.
