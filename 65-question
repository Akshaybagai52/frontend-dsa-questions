In the React Admin project, began by creating a comprehensive component sheet to identify reusable components required in the RCL (Reusable Component Library). Collaborated with the team to develop these components and then proceeded with module-wise implementation of the application.

Maintained clear communication with the Team Lead, providing regular updates and engaging in strategy discussions to effectively achieve the required functionality. Actively participated in all development activities including code reviews, issue discussions, and project timeline planning.

Applied the same structured and collaborative approach in other projects such as Enrollment Consumer and Eligibility Upload Documents, ensuring consistent and timely delivery.

Designed and developed several complex and reusable components in the RCL, such as CustomAdminHeader, CustomDragAndDropContext, CustomBackdropCard, and CardNavigation. These components have been integrated across multiple applications without requiring further modifications, showcasing robust design and flexibility.

Also built internal form components using react-hook-form, including DateInput, TextInput, ToggleButton, and Dropdown. These components have been successfully adopted in various projects like React Admin, Internal Admin, Admin Verifications, and ROP, reflecting strong reusability and code quality.

Individual Contribution

Approached the React Admin project methodicallyâ€”starting with thorough KT (Knowledge Transfer) sessions, asking relevant questions, and breaking down tasks into manageable phases. This included creating shared components, migrating APIs, developing UI screens, integrating APIs, and conducting thorough development testing.

Followed a disciplined QA process: maintained a bug tracking sheet during development testing, addressed issues proactively, and ensured a clean handover by performing a final round of testing post-merge. This helped minimize defects during OA testing and contributed to a smoother release cycle.
